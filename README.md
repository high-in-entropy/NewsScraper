# NewsScraper

This repository aims at coding python scripts which could scrape news articles from the archive of various Indian News Agencies [currently TOI] for a specific keyword.

Well yes there are APIs available which do the same task but all of them charge heavily for a simple task. There are some APIs which say they are free for Non-commercial research work but offer us news articles which are at maximum 6 months old! I don't know how they suppose we could do research with only 6 months of articles:)
# What one can do..
* Can be used for research purpose where articles are required to be studied.
* Can be used to analyse political drift over the years.
* Can be used to analyse shift in public demands

And all those things which come to your mind when we are studying articles which are let's say decades old!
